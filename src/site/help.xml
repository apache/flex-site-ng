      </h5>
      <p>It has never been easier to build interactive online maps with Flex. There is a wide range of APIs now available. The focus of this article is building a simple map application using the
        open-source Modest Maps Flex API. Modest Maps offers a number of advantages over other Flex mapping APIs including the ability to point at multiple basemap providers and direct access to the
        source code.
