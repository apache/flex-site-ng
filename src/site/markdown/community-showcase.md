# Flex Showcase!

Some of the many desktop and mobile applications written with Flex, listed in alphabetical order.

## How to submit your application?
Want to see your app showcased here ? It's easy to make a submission:

- Create a ticket of type "Task" on our [Bug &amp; Issue Tracker][1], under the Component "Showcase"
- Include a title and  brief description (5 lines max)
- Indicate the author or company name, if different from the ticket submitter name
- Include links to web site, videos, App Store, Google Play, etc.
- Attach screen shots (up to 3) of your application, in jpeg or png format.
To speed up the process, you can include the screen shots in two sizes:  300px high for the preview, and full size.
- Provide if possible details about the implementation : version of Flex SDK / AIR,  MVC framework used, etc.
